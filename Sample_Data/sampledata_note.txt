This sample data set is only for the Labels of the Continuus GW data. This is used in training but this is not the entire input data. What is missing is the ".hdf5" file of the wave data. Each ".hdf5" file is around 30MB or more and this is beyond the GitHub file size limit of 25MB. So, we cannot show in this repo a sample of the ".hdf5" file for each wave.
